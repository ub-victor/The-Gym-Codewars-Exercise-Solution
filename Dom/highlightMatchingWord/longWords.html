    I am the third vehicle in the patrol so my cupola is always pointed right, the others cover their own arcs and together we create a lethal bubble, a pinprick of British-owned ground that roams back and forth across this continent as we please, or must. We’re currently heading north-east so if one were to fire an imaginary round it could in theory carry on to Niger, or Chad, or (curving slightly) even Kenya and the sea. I’ve spent a lot of time in Kenya – at Nanyuki or Archer’s Roast - and it’s so like here and so different I struggle to put into words exactly why.
